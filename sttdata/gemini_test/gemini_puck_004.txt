Keeping in mind that ice floats, and that Antarctica is an isolated polar continent, the ice sheet there has no place to go but into the ocean. Tidal and possibly thermal stresses at the edge of the floating ice sheet then "prune" the edge contantly through iceberg calving. The same process occurs along the oceanic portions of the arctic icecap.
